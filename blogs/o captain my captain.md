*o captain! my captain!*

These are the final words to the Dead Poet's Society, and possibly the most important conversation I will have in my life. For the past couple months I have come across the paramount question that every 18-year-old faces: what is my *purpose*? As I examined the community, people, and ideals around me, it seemed like everything was siphoned towards a predetermined path. One that is filled with a fancy degree, a six-figure salary, and a loving family in the nice suburbs. Yet, I felt unsatisifed. In a way, this felt distasteful to me. If 30 years later I woke up: wrinkled, exhausted, and worn out by life, would I be proud? Would I have lived up to the youthful exuberance that radiated across every moment. It is not until now that I have realized my answer - no.

As Mr. Keating would say "Only in their dreams can men be truly free" (1989). The movie deals with one true premise *carpe diem* - seize the day. I used to believe it was frivioulous, but I have realized that it has run the undercurrent of my thought. I have begun to realize that I don't fear failure and that has led to me resonate with Mr. Keating's teachings. So much could be said about the movie, but I'll summarize it in three words. It was brilliant.

To live delibretly, I have to examine myself. Who am I? Where do my values come from? There is only one answer that truly shaped myself: my mom. It is with immense pride that I can say I'm her son. In every shape, way, and form, I have come about to this world through the love that she has provided. Today, I had a conversation that will shape my life. I cannot disclose the exact conversation. That is for my heart only. But, I have realized the monumental struggle she has overcome. She is brilliant in every way. We came from nothing, and we have only risen from the bottom. To understand I came from a desolate place just one generation ago, I do not fear failure. We as a family have come from worse, yet we will succeed because we have something innately special.

I worry one thing though. Our family is deeply kind. Affection runs deep in our blood, and our world isn't particularily run on that attitude. However, I will not change that. I have been in a struggle on whether to become more cynical or fall into the romanticist that I am. It seems to me that all the great romantics - Nieztche, Neil (Dead Poet's Society), Lord Byron - have fallen into depression and gloom. The swing of emotions leads one to fall towards both sides of the spectrum. But, I believe there is a strong path towards the hopeful future while maintaing a stone front.

Here I would like to outline my beliefs on what I must do.
1. Understand that imperfections are simply nothing more than that.
2. Be amicable, but strong. Show a wide net, but keep a tight string. The people closest to me *must* be good at heart.
3. Fight ferociously and fight hard.

Today, I am a mix of emotions. I am proud. I am hopeful. And, I am determined to do good.

As Whitman said, That the powerful play goes on and you may contri bute a verse. What will your verse be?

I have chosen mine.
