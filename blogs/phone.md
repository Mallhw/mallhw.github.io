## phones

Phones cause unhapiness. 

I came to this realization recently. For a long time, I noticed that when I finished fencing I seemed much happier about myself. I was content. I attributed this phenomena to the endorphines released during fencing, however I believe I have overlooked another possibility: phones. Because one that fencing, and all great sports do, is create entire hours of zero screen time. There is no way to pick up a phone when doing burpees or hitting lunges, which leads to long periods of intense focus. 

I am not sure whether this is the entire reason for my happiness post-fencing, but I do believe this has potential. When I'm at home, it's almost irresistable to pick up my phone, scrolling instagram reels or checking my DMs. In fact, it's pretty much required. If I had to estimate, I probably hop on my phone every 5 minutes or so during a study session. That cannot be productive at all. I'm sure this is even worse considering the fact that I utilize my computer, which has been happily jailbroken, to scroll instgram reels even more. Yet, despite this addiction, I don't believe it leads to satisfcation at all.
