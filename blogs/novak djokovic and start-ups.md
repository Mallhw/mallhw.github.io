In the 2026 Australian Open, something unpreccedentend happened. Novak Djokovic, age 38, beat Jannik Sinner, age 24, in a 5 set semi-final match. For someone that is an entire generation older to beat the prime player of the ATP tour is an astounding achievment. Jannik Sinner is considered untouchable. Jannik Sinner has a 96.6% win rate against people not named Carlos Alcaraz. That is insane.

Examining the match itself Jannik Sinner won 152 of the points while Novak Djokovic won only 140 points. Jannik was better on first serve, aces, double faults, win rate, and recieving points. By all advanced metrics, Jannik should have won.
